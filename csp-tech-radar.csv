ELK Stack,adopt,tools,TRUE,"Supporting and developing distributed systems requires the ability to debug events that occur across many systems. Having the logs emitted from each system centralised in a single store that is easily searched is vital for this. The ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) Stack is a mature open source platform for this task."
CodeScene,adopt,tools,TRUE,"CodeScene identifies patterns in the evolution of your code. This gives you the power to predict its future and find areas that are hard to evolve and prone to defects (i.e. areas of ""tech debt""). This tool has been successfully trialled by many teams over the last few years and its recent v4 upgrade has made it even easier to use. For more information about onboarding, please read this <a href=""https://developer.bskyb.com/wiki/display/CSEH/CodeScene"">wiki page</a>."
Prometheus and Grafana,adopt,tools,TRUE,"For monitoring and altering of the health of applications in production, the ability to collect and store time series data is important. Prometheus and Grafana provide a set of mature tools to achieve this."
OpenAPI,adopt,tools,TRUE,"OpenAPI is now the leading standard for creating specifications for RESTful API and describing JSON messages. Our department's CSC Interface Specifications initiative is making a big push to get all our interfaces properly documented using OpenAPI. For more information about how to use OpenAPI and the tooling supporting it, please visit the <a href=""https://developer.bskyb.com/wiki/display/CSEH/CSC+Interface+Specifications"">CSC Interface Specifications initiative wiki page</a>."
Pact Foundation,trial,tools,TRUE,A cross platform testing tool framework used for Consumer Driven Contract Testing. It generates JSON contracts via unit tests which can then be exchanged with the provider. It involves minimal setup for both Provider and Consumer and has well written documentation and resources dedicated to it. Its power lies in its simplicity.
Blackduck,trial,tools,TRUE,"Adding security scans to your CI/CD pipeline has never been easier with the Blackduck tooling. It checks for known vunerabilities and license problems for each of your project's dependencies. The PMP team are already using it and all GOTT projects for Peacock are using it too. If your team is interested in using this tool, please let us know and we will organise help from the PMP team or Jake Straker from the OTT Security team. "
Dependabot,assess,tools,TRUE,"A tool that complements Blackduck is Dependabot. This tool automatically updates your project's dependencies for you by creating PRs that your team can quickly accept if your tests still pass. If your team uses GitHub and would like to help assess it, please let us know. It's as easy as adding <a href=""https://dependabot.com/docs/config-file/"">a configuration file</a> to your GitHub repo."
Consul,hold,tools,TRUE,"Given Kubernetes is our strategic deployment platform of choice, Kubernetes' service discovery and configuration management features make the need for Consul redundant. While systems not yet on Kubernetes may require these features, we would recommend holding off creating more infrastructure with Consul and instead invest the effort moving to k8s."
Semantic Versioning,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Correctly versioning software that makes sense to everyone using it isn't easy. Using a mature versioning scheme like <a href=""https://semver.org/"">Semantic Versioning</a> helps you version your software service APIs in a way that allows consumers of your service to easily understand the severity of the changes in the new version. It is important to remember that a corresponding git tag of the version should be applied to the commit in the VCS that the versioned artifact was built from."
Pipelines as Code,adopt,techniques,TRUE,Pipelines as code is defining the build and deployment pipeline declaratively through code instead of configuring it in a specific CI/CD tooling.
Pair Programming,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"">Pair Programming</a> is an Agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at some kind of shared workstation setup. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. We believe that although this may seem as an inefficient usage of our developers' time, the quality of the code produced leads to less time consuming problems later. Other benefits include improved knowledge and skills sharing and team communication."
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight <a href=""http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions"">Architecture Decision Records</a> is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We recommend storing these details in <a href=""https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools"">source control</a>, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself. For most projects, we see no reason why you wouldn't want to use this technique."
Internal Open Source Products,trial,techniques,TRUE,"To help maintain and govern internal libraries that are shared across teams, the libraries can be treated as products that follow the open source model for governance and contribution."
Long lived branches with Gitflow,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Gitflow is a strict branching pattern for releases using Git. Although not an inherently bad pattern, we often see it misused. If the feature and develop branches are short lived and merged often, you are really using the power of Git, which makes these activities easy. However, a problem we often see is that these become long lived branches, which results in the dreaded merge conflicts many people began using Git to escape. A merge is a merge. Regardless of the source control tool or pattern you use. If you wait more than a day or two to merge, you could hit a big merge conflict. This becomes a real issue if you have a larger team. If you have more than a few people waiting to merge, you can have a serious a bottleneck. Introducing patterns like Gitflow require the discipline to merge often to be successful. So by all means use the pattern, but only if you have the discipline to prevent long lived branches"
Microservices Envy,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Microservices can offer significant advantages to organizations, in terms of improving team autonomy and faster frequency of change. The additional complexity that comes from distributed systems requires an additional level of maturity and investment. We are concerned that some teams are rushing into adopting microservices without understanding the changes to development, test, and operations that are required to do them well. Our general advice remains simple. Avoid microservice envy and start with one or two services before rushing headlong into developing more, to allow your team's time to adjust and understand the right level of granularity."
Testing as a separate team,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Fast feedback is a core tenet of Agile and critical to the success of a project. Using a separate QA team slows down this feedback, creates an ""us and them"" mentality and makes it more difficult to build quality into the software. Testing should be a tightly integrated activity and isn't something the team can outsource. We recommend integrated teams where testers work closely with developers instead of having testing as a separate organization."
Anemic REST,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Failure to properly model the domain as a set of resources. Naively developing services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs result in an anemic REST implementation. In a richly modelled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modelled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services"
Docker & Kubernetes (Core Platform),adopt,platforms,TRUE,"The Core Platform is the CSP favoured microservice hosting solution, it is GitOps with Docker and Kubernetes on AWS (https://core-platform-wiki.dev.cosmic.sky/). The Docker image format makes it easier to achieve parity between development and production, making for reliable deployments. It is a natural fit in a microservices-style application as a packaging mechanism for self-contained services. Kubernetes is Google's answer to the problem of deploying containers into a cluster of machines."
ActiveMQ,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Apache ActiveMQ is an open source message broker written in Java together with a full Java Message Service (JMS) client. KahaDB is the default storage database. Still used in a number of projects, with intentions to migrate towards Kafka. ActiveMQ is a push based system, whereas Kafka is pull based system with a more efficient storage format. Please contact the CSP SRE team for more information."
Couchbase (DocumentDB),adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Couchbase (not to be confused with CouchDB) is a fast, scalable NoSQL database that is well used and trusted within Sky OTT. Its masterless architecture makes it easier to scale and maintain than MongoDB and its built-in caching layer gives it better performance. Depending on your requirements, Cassandra is still top when it comes to Availability and Fault Tolerance, however Couchbase’s default CP configuration makes it a good option for ensuring Consistency. Contact CSP-SRE for more information on DB technologies available within CSP"
RDBMS,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"If the data you are looking to persist is relational in structure, and ACID compliance is of the utmost importance (i.e. large volume of concurrent transactions), you may require a more traditional RDBMS technology such as MYSQL, Oracle or Cockroach. If this is the case, the CSP-SRE team are the best point of contact for information on the DB technologies available within CSP"
Kafka,trial,platforms,TRUE,"Apache Kafka is a messaging framework that provides a solution for publishing ordered event feeds to large numbers of independent, lightweight consumers. Configuring Kafka can be difficult, contact the SRE team for help. For CSP usage see https://developer.bskyb.com/wiki/display/CSEH/CSP+Kafka"
.Net Core,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Java and the JVM is our department's primary server side language and platform of choice. However, where there are still large C# codebases that we wish to dockerise and deploy to the Core Platform, porting the codebase to run on the .NET Core platform (v2.0 and above) is a great option to save time, if possible. Be careful to ensure all our dependencies are supported by .Net Core platform (i.e .Net Standard 1.0+ compliant). We've experienced more obscure .net libraries being abandoned in the past and not having .Net Core support."
Hazelcast,assess,platforms,FALSE,"For database caching, Hazelcast IMDG stores frequently accessed data in memory across an elastically scalable data grid. With its write-through and write-behind capabilities, Hazelcast can propagate any changes in the cached data back to the original store either synchronously or asynchronously. Hazelcast supports entry processing. An entry processor enables fast in-memory operations on your map without you having to worry about locks or concurrency issues. Hazelcast runs the entry processor for all entries on a partitionThread so there will NOT be any interleaving of the entry processor and other mutations. Hazelcast sends the entry processor to each cluster member and these members apply it to map entries - adding more members just means it can process faster. Contact the Gonzales team as they are using it."
Windows Server,hold,platforms,TRUE,The Core Platform is our department's deployment infrastructure of choice. Avoid anything that requires Windows Server operating system to run.
React JS,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"In the avalanche of front-end JavaScript frameworks, React.js stands out due to its design around a reactive data flow. Allowing only one-way data binding greatly simplifies the rendering logic and avoids many of the issues that commonly plague applications written with other frameworks. This library has been widely adopted across Sky’s SWE department as the User Interface library of choice and there is now a large wealth of knowledge around it in the department."
Redux JS & Immutable JS,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"With the increasing complexity of single-page JavaScript applications, we have seen a more pressing need to make client-side state management predictable. Redux, with its three principles of restrictions for updating state, has proven to be invaluable in a number of projects we have implemented. <br/> 'Getting Started with Redux' and 'Idiomatic Redux' tutorials are a good starting point for new and experienced users. It is a minimal library with a rich ecosystem of utility libraries, all which make unit-testing easier with minimal amounts of mocking. Be sure to use Immutable JS objects in your state store to improve predicatbility and ease of debugging even further. <br/> That being said, for apps with simple state storage needs (like a simple support UI), then leveraging React 16.8's hooks feature is a great alternative."
Python 3,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Python 3 introduced many useful features that are not backward compatible with Python 2.x. It also removed numerous Python 2.x features that were maintained for backward compatibility, making Python 3 easier to learn and use and more consistent with the rest of the language. If you are developing in Python we strongly encourage you to use Python 3."
Spring Boot,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"A lot of work has gone into Spring Boot to reduce complexity and dependencies. If you live in a Spring ecosystem and are moving to microservices, Spring Boot is now the obvious choice. "
OpenJDK11,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"There are lots of new language features provided after Java 8 that should help us. Also as of Java 11 OracleJDK and OpenJDK will essentially be identical, so there is no additional benefit to paying to use Oracle's commercial JDK other than having direct access to Oracle support and help. Find it at <a href='https://jdk.java.net/11/'>https://jdk.java.net/11/</a>"
ASP.Net Core,trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"If you are looking to move legacy ASP.Net web applications to run on the linux .Net Core platform, moving to the .Net Core flavour of ASP.Net will require some code changes in the way your application is bootstrapped. But much of your application will remain unchanged."
Quartz,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Quartz is a richly featured, open source job scheduling library that can be used to create simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even tens-of-thousands of jobs. The Quartz Scheduler includes many enterprise-class features, such as support for JTA transactions and clustering. Quartz is being used in the Asset Publishing Tool and Metadata Migration Tool which are scheduling batch jobs."
TypeScript, trial, languages & frameworks,TRUE,"TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces. One of the big benefits is to enable IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code."
Kotlin,assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""http://kotlinlang.org/"">Kotlin</a> has experienced an accelerated rate of adoption and rapid growth of tooling support. Some of the reasons behind its popularity are its concise syntax, null safety, ease of transition from Java and interoperability with other JVM-based languages in general, and that it doubles as a great introductory language to functional programming. With JetBrains adding the ability to compile Kotlin to native binaries on multiple platforms, as well as transpile to JavaScript, we believe it has the potential of much wider use by the larger community of mobile and native application developers. Some of the tooling such as static and coverage code analysis have yet to mature, but given the industry adoption of Kotlin in many production applications, we believe Kotlin should be assessed in our department."
GraphQL,assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"When we look at REST implementations in the wild, we frequently see REST misused to naively retrieve object graphs through chatty interactions between client and server. Facebook's <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/graphql"">GraphQL</a> is an interesting alternative to REST that might be a better approach for this very common use case. As a protocol for remotely retrieving object graphs, GraphQL has received enormous attention recently. One of GraphQL's most interesting features is its consumer-oriented nature: The structure of a response is driven entirely by the client, not the server. This decouples the consumer and forces the server to obey Postel's law. Client implementations are now available in many programming languages, but we have seen a flurry of interest of Facebook's Relay, a JavaScript framework that was designed to support the React.js stateless component model."
FF4J,assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,It is becoming clear that using a Continuous Delivery process in conjunction with a platform comprising of a large suite of microservices requires a Feature Flag management tool to allow changes to be deployed but not necessarily released to an environment. FF4J was considered to be the leading free and supported tool for use with Java (https://ff4j.github.io/).
OracleJDK8,hold,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Oracle's JDK8 reached 'End of Public Updates' in January 2019. Any new public updates will only be released for <strong>personal use only</strong> and <strong>should not be used</strong> by Sky in a commercial capacity! To avoid not being able to recieve security updates, move off OracleJDK8 and start using OpenJDK alternatives. Ideally OpenJDK11."
