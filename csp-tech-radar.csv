Semantic Versioning,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Correctly versioning software that makes sense to everyone using it isn't easy. Using a mature versioning scheme like <a href=""https://semver.org/"">Semantic Versioning</a> helps you version your software service APIs in a way that allows consumers of your service to easily understand the severity of the changes in the new version. It is important to remember that a corresponding git tag of the version should be applied to the commit in the VCS that the versioned artifact was built from."
Pipelines as Code,adopt,techniques,TRUE,Pipelines as code is defining the build and deployment pipeline declaratively through code instead of configuring it in a specific CI/CD tooling.
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight <a href=""http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions"">Architecture Decision Records</a> is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We recommend storing these details in <a href=""https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools"">source control</a>, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself. For most projects, we see no reason why you wouldn't want to use this technique."
Internal Open Source Products,trial,techniques,TRUE,"To help maintain and govern internal libraries that are shared across teams, the libraries can be treated as products that follow the open source model for governance and contribution."
Long lived branches with Gitflow,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Gitflow is a strict branching pattern for releases using Git. Although not an inherently bad pattern, we often see it misused. If the feature and develop branches are short lived and merged often, you are really using the power of Git, which makes these activities easy. However, a problem we often see is that these become long lived branches, which results in the dreaded merge conflicts many people began using Git to escape. A merge is a merge. Regardless of the source control tool or pattern you use. If you wait more than a day or two to merge, you could hit a big merge conflict. This becomes a real issue if you have a larger team. If you have more than a few people waiting to merge, you can have a serious a bottleneck. Introducing patterns like Gitflow require the discipline to merge often to be successful. So by all means use the pattern, but only if you have the discipline to prevent long lived branches"
Microservices Envy,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Microservices can offer significant advantages to organizations, in terms of improving team autonomy and faster frequency of change. The additional complexity that comes from distributed systems requires an additional level of maturity and investment. We are concerned that some teams are rushing into adopting microservices without understanding the changes to development, test, and operations that are required to do them well. Our general advice remains simple. Avoid microservice envy and start with one or two services before rushing headlong into developing more, to allow your team's time to adjust and understand the right level of granularity."
Testing as a separate team,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Fast feedback is a core tenet of Agile and critical to the success of a project. Using a separate QA team slows down this feedback, creates an ""us and them"" mentality and makes it more difficult to build quality into the software. Testing should be a tightly integrated activity and isn't something the team can outsource. We recommend integrated teams where testers work closely with developers instead of having testing as a separate organization."
Anemic REST,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Failure to properly model the domain as a set of resources. Naively developing services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs result in an anemic REST implementation. In a richly modelled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modelled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services"

SNS supports various messaging patterns, including pub/sub (publish/subscribe) and direct messaging to applications or users via SMS, email, or HTTP endpoints. It is designed for high throughput, reliability, and scalability, making it suitable for use cases such as sending notifications, alerting, and triggering workflows.<br /><br /><p><strong>Teams: </strong>Vesuvius, K2, Rosa, Bianco</p>"
AWS Elasticache,assess,platforms,TRUE,"Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory caching service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services). It supports two popular open-source in-memory caching engines: Redis and Memcached. ElastiCache is designed to improve the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve data from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. It is commonly used for use cases such as caching frequently accessed data, session storage, and real-time analytics, providing low-latency and high-throughput data access.<br /><br /><p><strong>Teams: </strong>Gonzales</p>"
Kafka,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency data streams and is capable of processing millions of events per second. Kafka is commonly used for log aggregation, real-time analytics, event sourcing, and stream processing. It provides a publish-subscribe messaging model, where producers send data to topics and consumers read from these topics. Kafka ensures fault tolerance and durability by replicating data across multiple nodes in a cluster.<br /><br /><p><strong>Teams: </strong>Olympus, Krakatoa, Everest, Fuji</p>"
AWS SQS,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services). It enables the decoupling and scaling of microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications by allowing asynchronous communication between components. SQS supports two types of message queues: Standard Queues, which offer high throughput and at-least-once delivery, and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Queues, which ensure exactly-once processing and message order. SQS is designed for reliability, scalability, and security, making it suitable for use cases such as task queues, message buffering, and asynchronous workflows.<br /><br /><p><strong>Teams: </strong>Rosa, Bianco</p>"
ActiveMQ,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Apache ActiveMQ is an open-source message broker written in Java that supports the Java Message Service (JMS) API. It facilitates communication between different applications by sending messages between them, enabling asynchronous communication and decoupling of components. ActiveMQ supports various messaging protocols, including AMQP, MQTT, and STOMP, and provides features like message persistence, load balancing, and high availability. It is commonly used for enterprise messaging, integrating systems, and ensuring reliable message delivery in distributed applications.<br /><br /><p><strong>Teams: </strong>Olympus, Krakatoa, Everest, Ben More, Matterhorn, Gonzales, Rockies, Vestrahorn, Hauscaran, Fuji</p>"
