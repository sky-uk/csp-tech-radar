Semantic Versioning,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Correctly versioning software that makes sense to everyone using it isn't easy. Using a mature versioning scheme like <a href=""https://semver.org/"">Semantic Versioning</a> helps you version your software service APIs in a way that allows consumers of your service to easily understand the severity of the changes in the new version. It is important to remember that a corresponding git tag of the version should be applied to the commit in the VCS that the versioned artifact was built from."
Pipelines as Code,adopt,techniques,TRUE,Pipelines as code is defining the build and deployment pipeline declaratively through code instead of configuring it in a specific CI/CD tooling.
Health check pages,adopt,techniques,TRUE,Adding simple health check pages to applications is incredibly useful. This allows people to quickly understand the health of an individual node.
12 Factor Apps,adopt,techniques,TRUE,The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps.
Consumer-driven contract testing,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"When two independently developed services are collaborating, changes to the supplier’s API can cause failures for all its consumers. Consuming services usually cannot test against live suppliers since such tests are slow and <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/nonDeterminism.html#RemoteServices"">brittle</a>, so it’s best to use <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html"">Test Doubles</a> (a.k.a. endpoint simulators) or they are just not available yet,, leading to the danger that the test doubles get out of sync with the real supplier service. Consumer teams can protect themselves from these failures by using <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationContractTest.html"">integration contract tests</a> (a.k.a. assumption tests) – tests that compare actual service responses with test values. While such contract tests are valuable, they are even more useful when consuming services provide these tests to the supplier, who can then run all their consumers’ contract tests to determine if their changes are likely to cause problems or a consumer's assumptions are incorrect – adopting <a href=""http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html"">consumer-driven contracts</a>. Such <strong>consumer-driven contract tests</strong> are an essential part of a mature <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/"">microservice testing</a> portfolio."
Pair Programming,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"">Pair Programming</a> is an Agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at some kind of shared workstation setup. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. We believe that although this may seem as an inefficient usage of our developers' time, the quality of the code produced leads to less time consuming problems later. Other benefits include improved knowledge and skills sharing and team communication."
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight <a href=""http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions"">Architecture Decision Records</a> is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We recommend storing these details in <a href=""https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools"">source control</a>, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself. For most projects, we see no reason why you wouldn't want to use this technique."
Internal Open Source Products,trial,techniques,TRUE,"To help maintain and govern internal libraries that are shared across teams, the libraries can be treated as products that follow the open source model for governance and contribution."
Legacy in a box,assess,techniques,FALSE,"Working with legacy code, especially large monoliths, is one of the most unsatisfying, high-friction experiences for developers. Although we caution against extending and actively maintaining legacy monoliths, they continue to be dependencies in our environments, and developers often underestimate the cost and time required to develop against these dependencies. To help reduce the friction, developers have used virtualized machine images or container images with Docker containers to create immutable images of legacy systems and their configurations. The intent is to contain the legacy in a box for developers to run locally and remove the need for rebuilding, reconfiguring or sharing environments. In an ideal scenario, teams that own legacy systems generate the corresponding boxed legacy images through their build pipelines, and developers can then run and orchestrate these images in their allocated sandbox more reliably. Although this approach has reduced the overall time spent by each developer, it has had limited success when the teams owning the downstream dependencies have been reluctant to create container images for others to use."
Single CI instance for all teams,hold,techniques,TRUE,"While it's a nice idea in theory to consolidate and centralize Continuous Integration (CI) infrastructure, software delivery teams which must use the centralized CI offering regularly have long delays depending on a central team to perform minor configuration tasks, or to troubleshoot problems in the shared infrastructure and tooling."
Separate DevOps team,hold,techniques,TRUE,"DevOps is about creating a culture of shared responsibility in delivery teams. However where there is a need for significant investment in tooling and automation, we do see a role for a Delivery Engineering team."
Long lived branches with Gitflow,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Gitflow is a strict branching pattern for releases using Git. Although not an inherently bad pattern, we often see it misused. If the feature and develop branches are short lived and merged often, you are really using the power of Git, which makes these activities easy. However, a problem we often see is that these become long lived branches, which results in the dreaded merge conflicts many people began using Git to escape. A merge is a merge. Regardless of the source control tool or pattern you use. If you wait more than a day or two to merge, you could hit a big merge conflict. This becomes a real issue if you have a larger team. If you have more than a few people waiting to merge, you can have a serious a bottleneck. Introducing patterns like Gitflow require the discipline to merge often to be successful. So by all means use the pattern, but only if you have the discipline to prevent long lived branches"
Microservices Envy,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Microservices can offer significant advantages to organizations, in terms of improving team autonomy and faster frequency of change. The additional complexity that comes from distributed systems requires an additional level of maturity and investment. We are concerned that some teams are rushing into adopting microservices without understanding the changes to development, test, and operations that are required to do them well. Our general advice remains simple. Avoid microservice envy and start with one or two services before rushing headlong into developing more, to allow your team's time to adjust and understand the right level of granularity."
Testing as a separate team,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Fast feedback is a core tenet of Agile and critical to the success of a project. Using a separate QA team slows down this feedback, creates an ""us and them"" mentality and makes it more difficult to build quality into the software. Testing should be a tightly integrated activity and isn't something the team can outsource. We recommend integrated teams where testers work closely with developers instead of having testing as a separate organization."
Anemic REST,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Failure to properly model the domain as a set of resources. Naively developing services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs result in an anemic REST implementation. In a richly modelled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modelled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services"
ELK Stack,adopt,tools,TRUE,"Supporting and developing distributed systems requires the ability to debug events that occur across many systems. Having the logs emitted from each system centralised in a single store that is easily searched is vital for this. The ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) Stack is a mature open source platform for this task."
Prometheus and Grafana,adopt,tools,TRUE,"For monitoring and altering of the health of applications in production, the ability to collect and store time series data is important. Prometheus and Grafana provide a set of mature tools to achieve this."
Consul,trial,tools,TRUE,"Consul is a the service-discovery tool supporting both DNS- and HTTP-based discovery mechanisms. It goes beyond other discovery tools by providing customizable health checks for registered services, ensuring that unhealthy instances are marked accordingly. More tools have emerged to work with Consul to make it even more powerful. Consul Template enables configuration files to be populated with information from Consul, making things like client-side load balancing using mod_proxy much easier. In the world of Docker, registrator can automatically register Docker containers as they appear with Consul with extremely little effort, making it much easier to manage container-based setups. You should still think long and hard about whether you need a tool like this or whether something simpler will do, but if you decide you need service discovery, you won't go far wrong with Consul."
Pact Foundation,trial,tools,TRUE,"A cross platform testing tool framework used for Consumer Driven Contract Testing. It generates JSON contracts via unit tests which can then be exchanged with the provider. It involves minimal setup for both Provider and Consumer and has well written documentation and resources dedicated to it. Its power lies in its simplicity."
Docker,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Development teams love Docker, as the Docker image format makes it easier to achieve parity between development and production, making for reliable deployments. It is a natural fit in a microservices-style application as a packaging mechanism for self-contained services."
Kubernetes,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Kubernetes is Google's answer to the problem of deploying containers into a cluster of machines, which is becoming an increasingly common scenario."
Cassandra,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Apache's Cassandra database is a powerful, scalable Big Data solution for storing and processing large amounts of data, often using hundreds of nodes split over multiple worldwide locations. Use Cassandra carefully. Teams often misunderstand the use case for Cassandra, attempting to use it as a general-purpose data store when in fact it is optimized for fast reads on large data sets based on predefined keys or indexes. Its dependence on the storage schema can also make it difficult to evolve over time. Cassandra also has significant operational complexity and some rough edges, so unless you absolutely need the scaling it provides, a simpler solution is usually better."
Kafka,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Apache Kafka continues to build momentum as an open source messaging framework that provides a solution for publishing ordered event feeds to large numbers of independent, lightweight consumers. Configuring Kafka can be difficult."
.Net Core,trial,platforms,TRUE,".NET Core is an open source modular platform for creating applications that can be easily deployed in Windows, macOS and Linux. .NET Core makes it possible to build cross-platform web applications using ASP.NET Core with a set of tools, libraries and frameworks—another choice for microservices architecture."
Windows Containers,assess,platforms,FALSE,"To achieve legacy in a box for many of our CSP applications that target the .Net Framework, Windows Containers should be explored as a possible solution."
Oracle,hold,platforms,TRUE,Proprietary software is discouraged by the Open Source Software culture.
Microsoft Proprietary Platforms,hold,platforms,TRUE,Proprietary software is discouraged by the Open Source Software culture. Basically anything that requires Windows Server operating system to run.
MySQL,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"MySQL is a fast, reliable and stable open source database management system. It has most of the features which oracle provides.  It is a relational database and is suitable where persisting data in a relational way is beneficial. It is being used by PD/PMP."
Couchbase,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Couchbase (not to be confused with CouchDB) is a fast, scalable NoSQL database that is well used and trusted within Sky OTT. Its masterless architecture makes it easier to scale and maintain than MongoDB and its built-in caching layer gives it better performance. Depending on your requirements, Cassandra is still top when it comes to Availability and Fault Tolerance, however Couchbase’s default CP configuration makes it a good option for ensuring Consistency."
React JS,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"In the avalanche of front-end JavaScript frameworks, React.js stands out due to its design around a reactive data flow. Allowing only one-way data binding greatly simplifies the rendering logic and avoids many of the issues that commonly plague applications written with other frameworks. This library has been widely adopted across Sky’s SWE department as the User Interface library of choice and there is now a large wealth of knowledge around it in the department."
Redux JS,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"With the increasing complexity of single-page JavaScript applications, we have seen a more pressing need to make client-side state management predictable. Redux, with its three principles of restrictions for updating state, has proven to be invaluable in a number of projects we have implemented. Getting Started with Redux and idiomatic Redux tutorials are a good starting point for new and experienced users. Its minimal library design has spawned a rich set of tools, and we encourage you to check out the redux-ecosystem-links project for examples, middleware and utility libraries. We also particularly like the testability story: Dispatching actions, state transitions and rendering can be unit-tested separately from one another and with minimal amounts of mocking."
Python 3,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Python 3 introduced many useful features that are not backward compatible with Python 2.x. It also removed numerous Python 2.x features that were maintained for backward compatibility, making Python 3 easier to learn and use and more consistent with the rest of the language. If you are developing in Python we strongly encourage you to use Python 3."
Spring Boot,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"A lot of work has gone into Spring Boot to reduce complexity and dependencies. If you live in a Spring ecosystem and are moving to microservices, Spring Boot is now the obvious choice. "
Immutable JS,trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Immutability is often emphasized in the functional programming paradigm, and most languages have the ability to create immutable objects—objects that can't be changed once created. Immutable.js is a library for JavaScript that provides many persistent immutable data structures, which are highly efficient on modern JavaScript virtual machines. Immutable.js objects are, however, not normal JavaScript objects, so references to JavaScript objects from immutable objects should be avoided. Teams should investigate this library, especially when it's combined with the rest of the React & Redux stack."
ASP.Net Core,trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"If you are looking to move legacy ASP.Net web applications to run on the linux .Net Core platform, moving to the .Net Core flavour of ASP.Net will require some code changes in the way your application is bootstrapped. But much of your application will remain unchanged."
Quartz,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Quartz is a richly featured, open source job scheduling library that can be used to create simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even tens-of-thousands of jobs. The Quartz Scheduler includes many enterprise-class features, such as support for JTA transactions and clustering. Quartz is being used in the Asset Publishing Tool and Metadata Migration Tool which are scheduling batch jobs."
GraphQL,assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"When we look at REST implementations in the wild, we frequently see REST misused to naively retrieve object graphs through chatty interactions between client and server. Facebook's <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/graphql"">GraphQL</a> is an interesting alternative to REST that might be a better approach for this very common use case. As a protocol for remotely retrieving object graphs, GraphQL has received enormous attention recently. One of GraphQL's most interesting features is its consumer-oriented nature: The structure of a response is driven entirely by the client, not the server. This decouples the consumer and forces the server to obey Postel's law. Client implementations are now available in many programming languages, but we have seen a flurry of interest of Facebook's Relay, a JavaScript framework that was designed to support the React.js stateless component model."
