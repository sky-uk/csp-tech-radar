Semantic Versioning,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Correctly versioning software that makes sense to everyone using it isn't easy. Using a mature versioning scheme like <a href=""https://semver.org/"">Semantic Versioning</a> helps you version your software service APIs in a way that allows consumers of your service to easily understand the severity of the changes in the new version. It is important to remember that a corresponding git tag of the version should be applied to the commit in the VCS that the versioned artifact was built from."
Pipelines as Code,adopt,techniques,TRUE,Pipelines as code is defining the build and deployment pipeline declaratively through code instead of configuring it in a specific CI/CD tooling.
Pair Programming,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"">Pair Programming</a> is an Agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at some kind of shared workstation setup. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. We believe that although this may seem as an inefficient usage of our developers' time, the quality of the code produced leads to less time consuming problems later. Other benefits include improved knowledge and skills sharing and team communication."
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight <a href=""http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions"">Architecture Decision Records</a> is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We recommend storing these details in <a href=""https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools"">source control</a>, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself. For most projects, we see no reason why you wouldn't want to use this technique."
Internal Open Source Products,trial,techniques,TRUE,"To help maintain and govern internal libraries that are shared across teams, the libraries can be treated as products that follow the open source model for governance and contribution."
Long lived branches with Gitflow,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Gitflow is a strict branching pattern for releases using Git. Although not an inherently bad pattern, we often see it misused. If the feature and develop branches are short lived and merged often, you are really using the power of Git, which makes these activities easy. However, a problem we often see is that these become long lived branches, which results in the dreaded merge conflicts many people began using Git to escape. A merge is a merge. Regardless of the source control tool or pattern you use. If you wait more than a day or two to merge, you could hit a big merge conflict. This becomes a real issue if you have a larger team. If you have more than a few people waiting to merge, you can have a serious a bottleneck. Introducing patterns like Gitflow require the discipline to merge often to be successful. So by all means use the pattern, but only if you have the discipline to prevent long lived branches"
Microservices Envy,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Microservices can offer significant advantages to organizations, in terms of improving team autonomy and faster frequency of change. The additional complexity that comes from distributed systems requires an additional level of maturity and investment. We are concerned that some teams are rushing into adopting microservices without understanding the changes to development, test, and operations that are required to do them well. Our general advice remains simple. Avoid microservice envy and start with one or two services before rushing headlong into developing more, to allow your team's time to adjust and understand the right level of granularity."
Testing as a separate team,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Fast feedback is a core tenet of Agile and critical to the success of a project. Using a separate QA team slows down this feedback, creates an ""us and them"" mentality and makes it more difficult to build quality into the software. Testing should be a tightly integrated activity and isn't something the team can outsource. We recommend integrated teams where testers work closely with developers instead of having testing as a separate organization."
Anemic REST,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Failure to properly model the domain as a set of resources. Naively developing services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs result in an anemic REST implementation. In a richly modelled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modelled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services"
Java,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"One of the most popular programming languages across our department, with several versions over the years. Teams developing apps with Java 8 and 11 should migrate their codebase to be compatible with one of the 2 LTS versions: <b>17</b> and <b>21</b>.<br/>These versions include new features such as text blocks (17), improved switch statements (17), record types (17), virtual threads (21), string templates (21), etc.<br/><br/><p><strong>Teams: </strong>Wrights, Olympus, Everest, Ben More, Matterhorn, Etna, Rockies, Gonzales, Vestrahorn, Huascarán, Annapurna, Vesuvius, K2, Rosa, Fuji</p>"
Spring Boot,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Within the Java world, Spring Boot is <i>de facto</i> framework for creating Java micro-services in our department.<br/>Springboot 3 is its latest version and requires Java 17 as a mininum version to run.<br/>Teams using Springboot 2 should consider migrating to the latest version of this framework.<br/><br/><p><strong>Teams: </strong>Wrights, Olympus, Everest, Ben More, Gonzales, Huascarán, Annapurna, Fuji, Bianco</p>"
React,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"The React is a library to help build web interfaces in JavaScript, or TypeScript, which is widely used in our department. Currently on version 18.+ it is recommended that teams keep their React versions updated.<br/><br/><p><strong>Teams: </strong>Wrights, Olympus, Krakatoa, Everest, Ben More, Rockies, Gonzales, Vestrahorn, Huascarán, K2, Rosa, Fuji</p>"
C#,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Another popular programming language across our department. It has multiple implementations being the most notable <b>.NET</b> and <b>.NET Framework</b>.<br/>Teams deploying to the Cloud should be using the latest version of .NET (formerly known as .NET Core), whereas deploying to on-premises servers they can either choose between latest version of .NET or .NET Framework (preferably .NET)<br/>For libraries creation the preffered option should be for them to be compatible with <b>.NET Standard 2.0</b> (whenever possible), in order to ensure compatability with both .NET and .NET Framework versions with minimal maintenance effort.<br/><br/><p><strong>Teams: </strong>Wrights, Olympus, Krakatoa, Everest, Ben More, Etna, Rockies, Vestrahorn, Annapurna</p>"
C++,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"A very high performant general purpose programming language used in our department.

Python,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Python is versatile untyped programming language that has been used over the years in our department, being adopted initially as a programming language to create integration tests to more recently as a programming language to write functions for <b>AWS Lambdas</b>.<br/>Teams using <b>Python 2</b> should migrate to any of the supported versions of <b>Python 3</b> (>= 3.8).<br/><br/><p><strong>Teams:</strong> Wrights, Olympus, Krakatoa, Everest, Ben More, Etna, Rockies, Vestrahorn, Annapurna, Vesuvius, K2, Rosa, Bianco</p>"
Firefly,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"A C# development framework designed to help convert apps written in Magic uniPaaS to C#. It is the framework that apps such as BSS GUI uses.<br/>Due to its complexity, it is quite hard for C# developers to understand how to use it properly as it is not as famous as other Microsoft frameworks released for C#. In our department, we currently only have now a few people that mastered this framework.<br/>For that reason, we are trying to move away from this framework.<br/><br/><p><strong>Teams:</strong> Wrights, Olympus, Krakatoa, Everest, Rockies, Vestrahorn</p>"
PL/SQL,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Over the years PL/SQL has been used in conjunction with the development of BSS and other systems. Even though it is a great tool, it is hard to maintain, difficult to create tests for and can hide its visibility from the application code, increasing this way the complexity of our systems.<br/>One of the architectural principles in our department is to DBs as data stores only, for this reason we are trying to migrate our PL/SQL code to more maintainable application code.<br/><br/><p><strong>Teams:</strong> Wrights, Olympus, Krakatoa, Everest, Ben More, Matterhorn, Etna, Rockies, Vestrahorn</p>"
Knockout,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"JavaScript library that helps in the creation of web interfaces.<br/>As React took its place as the default framework to create UIs in our department, the Knockout framework lost its importance in our ecosystem.<br/><br/><p><strong>Teams:</strong> Rockies, Vestrahorn</p>"
