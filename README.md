# csp-tech-radar
The Content Supply Platforms department technology radar.

## Visualisation
The current Tech Radar can be viewed [here](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsky-uk%2Fcsp-tech-radar%2Fmaster%2Fcsp-tech-radar.csv) using the web application provided by ThoughtWorks.

## Goals
* Provide a succinct means for developers to view the technical opinions held by the department.
* To capture technical opinions in a collaborative and iterative way.

## Structure
All the technical opinions are captured as individual rows in a table kept in a simple [radar](csp-tech-radar.csv) CSV file.

The opinions are categorised into quadrants and rings on the radar as per the normal ThoughtWorks tech radar format.  
Opinions are only visualised as blips on a radar if they are 'in motion'. i.e. Only changed or new opinions are shown.

**Quadrants:**
* Programming Languages and Frameworks
* Tools
* Platforms
* Techniques

**Rings:**
* Adopt - Mature and ready for use. You should be using these technologies if they are appropriate for your problem.
* Trial - Proven to be ready for use but not yet widely used. Should be carefully monitored when used in production.
* Assess - Something new that we are excited about but not yet sure it is production ready. Evidence why it solves a particular problem should be collected through some kind of POC.
* Hold - We know these are not ready for use or we are actively avoiding going forward.
